Insert (insertNode)  :

    checkapplicationID() - N times
    while loop - N times    
    
    N+N = 2N --> Worst time complexity of O(N)

Search  :

    All of the Search functions: CGPA, applicationID, researchScore, name and Threshold have the
    Worst time complexitO(N)


Deletion (deleteNode)  :

    Worst time completion of O(N)



Merge (mergeList)  :

    while loop - (N)
        Insert Node -> already in order - (2N)

    +

    while loop - (N)
        Insert to the previous list - (N)


    (2N^2) + (N^2) --> Worst time complexity of O(N^2)
